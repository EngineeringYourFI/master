# Deciding When To Start Social Security Income Tool

This tool provides visualizations to assist a user in deciding when to start social security income.

## Getting Started

Modify the inputs in the WhenToStartSocialSecurityTemplate.py file and run that file as the driver script.

If you'd like to preserve the original file values for later reference, you can copy the file and rename as desired. Then simply plug your values into the new file and run as the driver script.

## More Information

See the following pages for more information:

* https://engineeringyourfi.com/when-should-you-start-social-security/

Note that within the embedded python interpreters (TBD) on those pages (running this same tool), the main driver script is called main.py because that is mandated by Trinket. 

I may change the main driver script in this repo to be named main.py in the future, to be consistent with the embedded interpreter on those pages. However, I like that having "Template" in the name currently makes it clearer that a user should modify the inputs in this script to match their own situation.

# Tools Built For [EngineeringYourFI.com](https://engineeringyourfi.com)

This repository provides a variety of tools that are discussed and employed for various personal finance analysis on [EngineeringYourFI.com](https://engineeringyourfi.com).

## Getting Started

Check out various tools in the appropriate subdirectories. 

Each directory should have a file with "Template" in the name that is the driver script you should modify with your inputs and then run. 

If you'd like to preserve the original file values for later reference, you can copy the file and rename as desired. Then simply plug your values into the new file and run as the driver script.

## More Information

See the [EngineeringYourFI.com Tools](https://engineeringyourfi.com/tools/) page for more information.

Note that many of the pages on [EngineeringYourFI.com](https://engineeringyourfi.com) contain Trinket embedded python interpreters, the main driver script in those interpreters is called main.py - because that is mandated by Trinket. These are the same as the "Template" driver file for each tool.
